= Lab: Configuration as Code

[abstract]
Learn how to manage your entire Ansible Automation Platform with collections for both Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration as Code (CaC) using Ansible playbooks. This includes deployment to OpenShift, as well as configuring various objects such as organizations, teams, users, credentials, projects, inventories, job templates, and execution environments through an automated, version-controlled processes.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Understand the principles of infrastructure and configuration as code
* Deploy AAP via `infra.aap_utilities`
* Configure AAP via `infra.aap_configuration`
* Manage AAP organizations, inventories, hosts, credentials and more through code

== 1: Introduction

In this module, we will explore how to manage Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) configurations declaratively as code using Ansible playbooks and the `infra.aap_configuration` and `infnra.aap_utilities` collections. instead of manually configuring settings through the AAP user interface (ClickOps). This approach allows for automated, repeatable, and version-controlled management of AAP settings, ensuring consistency across environments.

WARNING: In prior labs, we provided many of the values that are required to simplify the experience.

== 2. Lab Setup: Configuring Your Environment

We need to build a new Execution Environment with all our required collections including validated collections for `infra.aap_configuration` and `infra.aap_utilities` and their requirements. A few steps are needed to accomplish this.

=== 2.1: Add Required Collections to Remotes on PAH

Start by synching the required collections in Private Automation Hub.

. Go to *Automation Content* -> *Remotes* and edit *rh-certified*
. Ensure the following collections are specified in the *Requirements file* section:
+
NOTE: You may have additional collections from previous labs, just ensure these are appended to the list:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
collections:
  - ansible.platform
  - ansible.controller
  - ansible.hub
  - ansible.eda
  - ansible.posix
  - kubernetes.core
  - redhat.openshift
----
+
. Go to *Automation Content* -> *Remotes* and edit *validated*
. Ensure the following collections are specified in the *Requirements file* section:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
collections:
  - infra.aap_configuration
  - infra.aap_utilities
----
. Go to *Automation Content* -> *Repositories* and sync both of these repositories

=== 2.2: Local Environment Preparation

Create a new directory called `aap-as-code` for the resources that will be created within this lab and change into the newly created directory.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
mkdir /projects/aap-as-code
cd /projects/aap-as-code
----

=== 2.2: Create a new Execution Environment

Create a new `execution-environment.yml` file within the `aap-as-code` directory with the following contents:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="/projects/aap-as-code/execution-environment.yml"]
----

=== 2.3: Build the Execution Environment

Build a new execution environment (EE) that will enable the use of Config as Code.

NOTE: Ensure that the `PAH_API_TOKEN` environment variable is set within your terminal session so the build process can retrieve the required dependencies. You may need to run: `source /projects/env/set_pah_vars.env` again.

. Log in to your PAH container registry
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]

=== 2.4: Create a Secrets file

As a best practice, use a separate file to avoid putting any secrets directly in playbooks.

NOTE: If you completed the earlier labs in this module you will already have this file, simply append to it.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="/projects/env/secrets.yml"]
----
---
ansible_user: '{windows_user}'
ansible_password: '{windows_password}'
openshift_username: '{openshift_cluster_admin_username}'
openshift_password: '{openshift_cluster_admin_password}'
...
----

=== 2.5: Create Playbook to Install AAP

Create a playbook to call the `infra.aap_utilities.aap_ocp_install` role with task vars defining vital values:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="/projects/aap-as-code/install_aap.yml"]
----
---
- name: Install AAP on OCP
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Include AAP OCP Install role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.aap_utilities.aap_ocp_install
      vars:
        aap_ocp_install_connection:
          host: '{openshift_api_server_url}'
          username: '{{ openshift_username }}'
          password: '{{ openshift_password }}'
          validate_certs: false
        aap_ocp_install_namespace: aap-as-code
        aap_ocp_install_operator:
          channel: "stable-2.6"
        aap_ocp_install_platform:
          instance_name: lab
        aap_ocp_install_controller:
          install: true
        aap_ocp_install_eda:
          install: false
        aap_ocp_install_hub:
          install: false
          file_storage_size: 100Gi
          file_storage_storage_class: ocs-external-storagecluster-cephfs
        aap_ocp_install_lightspeed:
          install: false
...
----

NOTE: The more components installed at once, the longer it will take. These settings will start with *controller* only and allow you to enable and re-run with more components to iteratively deploy additional components, similar to the lab in Module 1.

== 3: Install AAP on OpenShift via Infrastructure as Code

=== 3.1: Run Installation Playbook

Now that the required environment is setup and Execution Environment created, we can test it locally:

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
ansible-navigator run \
  --execution-environment-image aap-aap.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/config_as_code_ee:1.0 \
  --mode stdout \
  install_aap.yml \
  --extra-vars @/projects/env/secrets.yml \
  --execution-environment-volume-mounts /projects/env:/projects/env:Z
----

NOTE: The installation process can take 10-15 minutes as OpenShift all the resources, depending on which components are enabled in the playbook.

[source,output]
----
[WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that
the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

----

=== 3.2: Verify the Deployment

Once the playbook completes, verify that the AAP components are running in OpenShift.

. Launch the link:{openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Web Console,window=_blank]
. Navigate to **Ecosystem** on the left hand navigation -> **Installed Operators**.
. Next to the `Project:` dropdown in the top left, ensure `aap-as-code` is the project shown.
. Click on the `Ansible Automation Platform` operator.
. In the toolbar, click on `All instances`.
. Verify installation was completed.
+
image::25-content-config-as-code/installed-operators-aap.png[Installed Operators in the AAP Project]
+
. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes*
. Open the URL under *Location* for the *lab* instance in a new window which should be link:https://lab-aap-as-code.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/
. Still within OpenShift, navigate to *Workloads* -> *Secrets*
. In the search box type `admin`
. Click on *lab-admin-password*
. Scroll to the bottom and copy the password
. Use `admin` as the username and the secret copied to login and verify
. Feel free as a bonus to modify your playbook and deploy additional items

== 4: Configuration As Code

Config as Code leverages standard Ansible variable files containing properties that will be used to drive the configuration of AAP. These variables include all the typical objects usually configured manually via ClickOps, organizations, inventories, hosts, projects, and other items that each have a role contained within the Config as Code collection that will configure these through modules.

=== 4.1: Define Secrets

The best practice is to use `ansible-vault` to encrypt files. For this lab we will keep our secrets in the same file we have been using for simplicity.

. Append the following variables to the `/projects/env/secrets.yml` file:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes,callouts",title="/projects/env/secrets.yml"]
----
aap_username: admin
aap_password: PASSWORD_FROM_OPENSHIFT<1>
----
<1> Obtain this random password from *OpenShift* -> *Workloads* -> *Secrets*.

=== 4.2: Define Environment Variables File

Since we already have a few AAP deployments on OpenShift, we can consider these different namespaces each a different AAP environment, with different URLs, secrets and resources for each deployment. For now let's create one for this environment.

. Create a new variable file to represent this environment. This would typically be handled by inventory `group_vars` or separate `vars_files`, but for this lab we'll simplify to a single file. Place this file in the same directory `/projects/aap-as-code/`:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes,callout",title="/projects/aap-as-code/lab.yml"]
----
---
aap_hostname: 'lab-aap-as-code.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}'<1>
aap_validate_certs: false
----
<1> Verify this is the correct hostname that was just deployed or modify as needed.

=== 4.3: Define some Configuration

Define a few objects as specified below in the data structure. Append the following to the environment variable file:

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="/projects/aap-as-code/lab.yml"]
----
aap_organizations:
  - name: config_as_code
aap_teams:
  - name: config as code team
    description: config as code team
    organization: config_as_code
controller_inventories:
  - name: super-lab
    organization: config_as_code
controller_hosts:
  - name: "Windows"
    inventory: "super-lab"
    variables:
      ansible_host: windows.aap.svc.cluster.local
      ansible_connection: psrp
      ansible_psrp_auth: negotiate
      ansible_psrp_cert_validation: ignore
    enabled: true
controller_credentials:
  - name: Windows
    description: Administrator user
    credential_type: Machine
    inputs:
      username: "{{ ansible_user }}"
      password: "{{ ansible_password }}"
----

=== 4.4: Create a playbook to apply the configuration

Create a simple playbook to call the `inra.aap_configuration.dispatch` role which will evaluate the variables defined and call the appropriate roles in the proper order based on precedence.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="/projects/aap-as-code/configure_aap.yml"]
----
---
- name: Playbook to configure AAP
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Call dispatch role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.aap_configuration.dispatch
...
----

=== 4.5: Run Configuration as Code Playbook

Run a similar command to what was used earlier in this lab to run the `install_aap.yml` playbook, but this time also attach the new environment file via a volume mount:

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
ansible-navigator run  \
  --execution-environment-image aap-aap.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/config_as_code_ee:1.0 \
  --mode stdout  \
  configure_aap.yml \
  --extra-vars @/projects/env/secrets.yml \
  --execution-environment-volume-mounts /projects/env:/projects/env:Z \
  --extra-vars @lab.yml \
  --execution-environment-volume-mounts $(pwd)/lab.yml:lab.yml:Z
----

WARNING: This is expected to fail. Review the output. If you look closely, some objects were created but ultimately it fails as follows:

----
<1> This is the failure but the details are hidden.

Check the AAP UI to see what worked and what didn't. The next section goes into troubleshooting steps.

=== 4.6: Verify Run

Verify what did work.

. Navigate to *Access Management* -> *Organizations* you should see the *config_as_code*
. Navigate to *Access Management* -> *Teams* you should see the *config_as_code*
. Navigate to *Automation Controller* -> *Infrastructure* -> *Credentials* there will NOT be a new credential created
. Navigate to *Automation Controller* -> *Infrastructure* -> *Inventories* no inventory or hosts were created either.

=== 4.7: Troubleshoot Failed Runs

The first time this playbook runs it will fail. By default you cannot see why because of secure logging. However, you get a clue by the failed `controller_credentials` task. If you read the readme for this role, you will see a section on how to disable secure logging. Add these two variables to the `lab.yml` environment file:

. View the role documentation for `controller_credential` at https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/validated/infra/aap_configuration/content/role/controller_credentials/
. Read the *Secure Logging Variables* section and define the two mentioned variables in that section.
. Append the following anywhere in the `lab.yml` file:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="/projects/aap-as-code/lab.yml"]
----
...
controller_configuration_credentials_secure_logging: false
aap_configuration_secure_logging: false

TIP: If an errors occurs during the execution with a message similar to  "Failed to get token: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized" while other tasks pass, please rerun the playbook. this is a known issue within the collection.

== 5: Review the Results

Once the playbook has completed successfully, navigate to link:https://lab-aap-as-code.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[AAP,window=_blank] to review the configurations that have been applied.

. Navigate to *Automation Controller* -> *Infrastructure* -> *Credentials* you should see the *Windows* credential
. Navigate to *Automation Controller* -> *Infrastructure* -> *Inventories* and you should see *super-lab*
* Select this inventory then *Hosts* tab
* Select *Windows* and review the variables which will match what was defined in the `lab.yml`
* Feel free to run `win_ping` module using the credential to verify

== 6: Publish Artifacts

With the proper configurations in place, we can save our work to our Gitea instance.

=== 6.1: Create Gitea Repository

Use the following steps to create a new repository on your Gitea instance.

. Navigate to your link:{gitea_console_url}[Gitea instance,window=_blank] and click the **Sign In** button on the upper right hand corner
. Enter the username and password using the credentials provided from the xref:environment-details.adoc[Environment Details,window=_blank] page and click the **Sign In** button
. In the top left corner, click on the **+** symbol and select **New Repository**.
. On the New Repository page, enter 'aap-as-code' in the Repository Name field.
. Leave everything else as default and click on the button at the bottom, **Create Repository**.

=== 6.2: Create `.gitignore` file

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your repository with the following content to exclude unnecessary files and directories from being tracked by Git.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title=".gitignore"]
----
context/
.password
ansible.cfg
.ansible/
.vscode/

----

=== 6.3: Push code to repository

After an empty repository is created on your Gitea, we need to push the collection to the repository.

In the section _Clone this repository_, click the **Copy URL** icon on the far right to copy Gitea repository URL for the _HTTPS_ protocol option.

Execute the following commands in the root directory of `aap-as-code` directory.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
git init
git switch --create main
git add --all
git commit --message "Uploading config on initial commit"
git remote add origin {gitea_console_url}/{gitea_user}/aap-as-code.git
git push origin main
----

== Conclusion

Within this lab, you have successfully implemented Configuration as Code using Validated Content provided for Ansible Automation Platform. In particular, you have completed the following tasks:

. Built custom Execution Environments with all required collections for AAP configuration
. Created structured variable files and encrypted secrets using Ansible Vault
. Configured organizations, teams, users, and service accounts
. Set up collection repositories, remotes, and automation credentials
. Deployed and configured Ansible projects, inventories, job templates, and workflows
. Performed all of the above configurations using the `infra.aap_configuration` collection

This approach enables you to manage your entire AAP infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency, version control, and repeatability across environments. The skills learned here form the foundation for managing complex enterprise automation platforms.
