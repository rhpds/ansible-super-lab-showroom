Welcome to the {lab_name}!

== Overview

The Automation AI Superlab provides a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). This superlab covers the full spectrum of automation development, from basic concepts to advanced CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, Event Driven Ansible and lastly an exploration of some of the Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed assistants.

Through a series of progressive labs, you'll gain practical experience with:

* **Development Environments**: Setting up and using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces for Ansible development
* **Content Development**: Creating, testing, and publishing Ansible collections
* **Automation Hub Management**: Managing content in Private Automation Hub
* **CI/CD Integration**: Building automated pipelines for collection development and deployment
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing AAP configuration through code
* **Cloud Deployments**: Deploying AAP on various platforms including Azure and OpenShift

== Prerequisites

Before starting this superlab, ensure you have:

* Basic understanding of Linux command line operations
* Familiarity with YAML syntax
* Knowledge of fundamental networking concepts
* Access to the Red Hat Demo Platform environment

== Lab Structure

The superlab is organized into sequential modules that build upon each other. Overall there flow of is broken into 4 major sections, each with separate labs:

* **Platform** - Covers OpenShift Dev Spaces, developer tooling, and the deployment of AAP on OpenShift.
* **Content** - Focuses on creating custom Ansible Content Collections, Execution Environments, and playbooks for Windows.
* **Events** - Dedicated to Event Driven Ansible (EDA), including rulebooks and event sources like AMQ Streams.
* **AI** - Explores AIOps, Ansible Intelligent and Coding Assistant, and integrating AI with automation.

== Learning Outcomes

By the end of this superlab, you will be able to:

* Set up and configure development environments for Ansible automation
* Develop, test, and publish Ansible collections
* Implement CI/CD pipelines for automation content
* Deploy and manage AAP across different platforms
* Apply infrastructure as code principles to automation platforms
* Troubleshoot and optimize automation workflows

== Getting Started

Begin with xref:10-platform-workspace.adoc[Module 1a: Platform - Introduction and exploration of Dev Spaces Workspace]] to set up your development environment. Each module includes detailed instructions, code examples, and verification steps.
