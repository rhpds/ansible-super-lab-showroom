Welcome to the {lab_name}!

== Overview

The {lab_name} provides a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). This superlab covers the full spectrum of automation development, from basic concepts to advanced CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, Event Driven Ansible and lastly an exploration of some of the AI integration within Ansible Automation Platform.

Through a series of progressive labs, you'll gain practical experience with:

* **Platform** - Covers OpenShift Dev Spaces, developer tooling, and the deployment of AAP on OpenShift.
* **Content** - Focuses on creating custom Ansible Content Collections, Execution Environments, and playbooks for Windows.
* **Events** - Dedicated to Event Driven Ansible (EDA), including rulebooks and event sources, like AMQ Streams.
* **AI** - Explores AIOps, Ansible Intelligent and Coding Assistant, and integrating AI with automation.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this superlab, ensure you have:

* Basic understanding of Linux command line operations
* Familiarity with YAML syntax
* Knowledge of fundamental networking concepts
* Access to the Red Hat Demo Platform environment

== Lab Structure

The superlab is organized into sequential modules that build upon each other. Overall there flow of is broken into 4 major sections, each with separate labs:

* **Platform** - Covers OpenShift Dev Spaces, developer tooling, and the deployment of AAP on OpenShift.
* **Content** - Focuses on creating custom Ansible Content Collections, Execution Environments, and playbooks for Windows.
* **Events** - Dedicated to Event Driven Ansible (EDA), including rulebooks and event sources like AMQ Streams.
* **AI** - Explores AIOps, Ansible Intelligent Assistants, and integrating AI with AAP.
