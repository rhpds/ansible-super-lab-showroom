= Module 1 Lab 1: Platform - OpenShift Dev Spaces for Ansible Development

[.sidebar]
****
* **Before you start:**
** Access to OpenShift Dev Spaces in xref:environment-details.adoc[Environment Details]
* **Prepares you for:** Launching OpenShift Dev Spaces
* **Lab Type:** Foundational (_activities in this lab prepare you for the remaining labs_)
* **Estimated Time:** 10 - 20 minutes
****

[abstract]
We will explore the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces environment you will be working within and learn how to launch and configure development workspaces for Ansible automation development. This includes understanding the various components available in the lab environment, authenticating with git repositories, and using the Ansible Development Tools.

This lab walks through the various components within the lab environment including launching, configuring and using Dev Spaces on OpenShift as your primary development environment for Ansible.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Navigate the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces interface
* Launch and configure development workspaces
* Understand the components included in the lab environment
* Set up authentication for git repositories
* Use basic Ansible Development Tools features

== 1: Introduction: What is included in the lab environment

. Red Hat OpenShift Cluster
. Ansible Automation Platform
. Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces
. link:https://about.gitea.com[Gitea,window=_blank] Git Server
. Windows 2019 managed host
. Lab Instructions

== 2: Contributing to this Lab Documentation

If you see an error in this lab, fork and submit a pull request against https://github.com/rhpds/ansible-super-lab-showroom

== 3: Dev Spaces console

link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces/[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces,window=_blank] provides consistent, reproducible development environments based on the open-source project link:https://eclipse.dev/che/[Eclipse Che,window=_blank].

It provides, by default, a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment as configured by a link:https://devfile.io[devfile,window=_blank], a YAML file that defines the entire workspace as code—including all necessary tools, runtimes, and project source. This file is used to instantly generate a pre-configured, containerized development environment, ensuring every developer on a team has an identical setup and solving the "it works on my machine" problem.

=== 3.1: Launching Dev Spaces from OpenShift

. Launch the link:{openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift Web Console,window=_blank]
. Select the **htpasswd_provider** button and use the credentials provided in the xref:environment-details.adoc[Environment Details,window=_blank] page to login to the OpenShift console
. Use the 9-block icon in the upper right to launch _Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces_ directly from the OpenShift console header.

TIP: Alternatively, the direct URL is link:https://devspaces.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://devspaces.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain},window=_blank] also available in xref:environment-details.adoc[Environment Details,window=_blank].

== 4: Dev Spaces Workspace

=== 4.1: Launching a specific Dev Spaces Workspace

Once you have launched the OpenShift Dev Spaces console, use the following steps to access your Ansible Dev Space workspace.

. Login via OpenShift authentication using the same credentials as the OpenShift console
. Select **Allow selected permissions** to authorize access and launch the console
. Scroll down and select the workspace titled **Ansible Dev Space**
+

+
NOTE: It will take a few minutes for the Dev Spaces instance to initialize. When it has loaded, a Visual Studio Code interface will appear.
+

+
. Click the **Trust Publishers and Install** button to trust the extension publishers that are included within the Dev Spaces workspace
. Click the **Yes, I trust the Authors** button to trust the workspace authors (your instructors).
. Wait a few minutes until the additional extension icons appear for Ansible and OpenShift on the left side.

== 5: Ansible and OpenShift Extensions

For this lab, we have have provided a link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspaces[.code-workspace,window=_blank] configuration that included these extensions along with additional configurations to curate your development environment. See https://github.com/jeffcpullen/devspaces-example/blob/main/devspaces.code-workspace for the source of this workspace configuration.

. Click on the **Ansible** extension icon to access the Ansible Development Tools extension (covered in a subsequent lab)

== 6: Accessing a Terminal

The majority of the exercises in this lab will be performed using the Visual Studio Code terminal.

. Open a new terminal by selecting the VS Code menu starting with the hamburger (3 horizontal lines) in the top left, then selecting **Terminal** -> **New Terminal**
